## How to Use

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

- The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
